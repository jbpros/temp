Feature: Cucumber Pro
  As a tester
  I would like to change the file
  So that i learn to use cucumber.pro.

	Scenario: Foo
  Things happen

    Given that I am an admin
    When I sign in
    Then I can view the dashboard
    And I see you
    And I get this:
      | var | val |
      | abc | 123 |
